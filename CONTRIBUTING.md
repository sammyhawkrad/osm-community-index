## Contributing

*If you don't understand the explanation below, feel free to [post an Issue](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-community-index/issues/new) to describe your community resources. That page contains some pointers to help you fill in all the info we  need. You do need [a Github account](https://github.com/join) to be able to post an Issue.*

There are 2 kinds of files in this project:

* Under `resources/` there are `.json` files to describe the community resources
* Under `features/` there are custom `.geojson` files

### tl;dr

To add your community resource to the index:

* Add resource `.json` files under the `resources/` folder
  * Each file contains info about what the resource is (slack, forum, mailinglist, facebook, etc.)
  * Each file also contains info about which locations the resource is active. The locations can be country or region codes, points, or custom `.geojson` files in the `features/*` folder.
  * You can copy and change an existing file to get started.
* run `npm run test`
  * This will check the files for errors and make them pretty.
  * If you don't have Node installed, you can skip this step and we will do it for you.
* If there are no errors, submit a pull request.


### Installing

* Clone this project, for example:
  `git clone git@github.com:osmlab/osm-community-index.git`
* `cd` into the project folder,
* Run `npm install` to install libraries


### Resources

These are `*.json` files found under the `resources/` folder.
Each resource file contains a single JSON object with information about the community resource.

Resource files look like this:

```js
{
  "id": "OSM-US-slack",
  "type": "slack",
  "locationSet": { "include": ["us"] }
  "languageCodes": ["en"],
  "name": "OpenStreetMap US Slack",
  "description": "All are welcome! Sign up at {signupUrl}",
  "extendedDescription": "OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that..."
  "signupUrl": "https://slack.openstreetmap.us/",
  "url": "https://osmus.slack.com",
  "order": 4,
  "contacts": [
    {
      "name" : "Barney Rubble",
      "email" : "b@rubble.com"
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "sotmus2019",
      "i18n": true,
      "name": "State of the Map US 2019",
      "description": "Join the OpenStreetMap community at State of the Map US in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "where": "Minneapolis, Minnesota",
      "when": "2019-sep-05",
      "url": "https://2019.stateofthemap.us/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here are the properties that a resource file can contain:

* __`id`__ - (required) A unique identifier for the resource.
* __`locationSet`__ - (required) Where the community resource is active (see below for details).
* __`type`__ - (required) Type of community resource (see below for list).
* __`name`__ - (required) Display name for this community resource
(in English, will be sent to Transifex for translation to other languages)
* __`description`__ - (required) One line description of the community resource
(in English, will be sent to Transifex for translation to other languages)
* __`extendedDescription`__ - (optional) Longer description of the community resource
(in English, will be sent to Transifex for translation to other languages)
* __`url`__ - (required) A url link to visit the community resource
* __`signupUrl`__ - (optional) A url link to sign up for the community resource
* __`languageCodes`__ - (optional) Array of [two letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) or [three letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) spoken by this community
* __`order`__ - (optional) When several resources with same geography are present, this adjusts the display order (default = 0, higher numbers display more prominently)
* __`contacts`__ - (optional) Contact information for people who are responsible for the resource.
* __`events`__ - (optional) Upcoming events that the resource wants to promote (see below for details).


#### locationSet

Each resource must have a `locationSet` to define where the resource is active.

```js
"locationSet": {
  "include": [ Array of locations ],   // required
  "exclude": [ Array of locations ]    // optional
}
```

The "locations" can be any of the following:
* Codes recognized by the [country-coder library](https://github.com/ideditor/country-coder#readme). These should be [ISO 3166-1 2 or 3 letter country codes or UN M.49 numeric codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_United_Nations_geoscheme).<br/>_Example: `"de"`_
* Points as `[longitude, latitude]` coordinate pairs.  A 25km radius circle will be computed around the point.<br/>_Example: `[8.67039, 49.41882]`_
* Filenames for `.geojson` features. If you want to use your own features, you'll need to add these under the `features/` folder.  Each `Feature` must have an `id` that ends in `.geojson`.<br/>_Example: `"de-hamburg.geojson"`_<br/>Tip: You can use [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) or other tools to create these.

See [location-conflation](https://github.com/ideditor/location-conflation#readme) project for details and examples.

#### contacts

Each community resource should have at least one contact person. This is optional.

* __`name`__ - (required) The contact person's name
* __`email`__ - (required) The contact person's email address


#### events

Resources may have upcoming events. These are optional.

* __`i18n`__ - (optional) if true, `name`, `description` and `where` will be translated
* __`id`__ - (required if `i18n=true`) A unique identifier for the event
* __`name`__ - (required) Name of the event
* __`description`__ - (required) One line description of the event
* __`where`__ - (required) Where the event is
* __`when`__ - (required) When the event is (Should be a string parseable by Date.parse, and assumed to be local time zone for the event)
* __`url`__ - (optional) A url link for the event


### Features

These are optional `*.geojson` files found under the `features/` folder. Each feature file contains a single GeoJSON `Feature` for a region where a community resource is active.

Feature files look like this:

```js
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "id": "boston_metro.geojson",
  "properties": {},
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [...]
  }
}
```

Note:  A `FeatureCollection` containing a single `Feature` is ok too - the build script can handle this.

There are many online tools to create or modify these `.geojson` files.
Drawing a simple shape with [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) works great.


### Building

* Just `npm run test`
  * This will check the files for errors and make them pretty.


### Translations

All community resources automatically support localization of the
`name`, `description`, and `extendedDescription` text.  These fields
should be written in US English.

The `description` and `extendedDescription` properties support the following
replacement tokens:

* __`{url}`__ - Will be replaced with the `url`
* __`{signupUrl}`__ - Will be replaced with the `signupUrl`

For example: "Sign up at {signupUrl}".

If a resource includes events, you can choose whether to write the
`name`, `description`, and `where` fields in your local language, or
write in US English and add `"i18n": true` to allow translation of these
values (useful for events with a wider audience).

```js
{
  "id": "OSM-US-Slack",
  "name": "OpenStreetMap US Slack",
  ...
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "sotmus2019",
      "i18n": true,
      "name": "State of the Map US 2019",
      "description": "Join the OpenStreetMap community at State of the Map US in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "where": "Minneapolis, Minnesota",
      "when": "2019-sep-05",
      "url": "https://2019.stateofthemap.us/"
    }
}
```

Translations are managed using the
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/id-editor/) platform.
After signing up, you can go to [iD's project page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/id-editor/),
select a language and click **Translate** to start translating.

The translation strings for this project are located in a resource called
[**community**](https://www.transifex.com/openstreetmap/id-editor/community/).


#### For maintainers

Transifex will automatically fetch the source file from this repository daily.
We need to manually pull down and check in the translation files whenever we
make a new release (see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)).

To work with translation files,
[install the Transifex Client](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction) software.

The Transifex Client uses a file
[`~/.transifex.rc`](https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration#-transifexrc)
to store your username and password.

Note that you can also use a
[Transifex API Token](https://docs.transifex.com/api/introduction#authentication)
in place of your username and password.  In this usage, the username is `api`
and the password is the generated API token.

Once you have installed the client and setup the `~/.transifex.rc` file, you can
use the following commands:

* `tx push -s`  - upload latest source `/i18n/en.yaml` file to Transifex
* `tx pull -a`  - download latest translation files to `/i18n/<lang>.yaml`

For convenience you can also run these commands as `npm run txpush` or `npm run txpull`.
